        <p>A quick look into my professional background, as well as a peak into my life outside of profesionalism. This is all my work! Keep that in mind while browsing my website!</p>
        <h2>The basics</h2>
        <p> starting with the basics, I am 22 years old, graduated Stadium highschool 2021...
        I live in a 2 bedroom apt in Tacoma Wa. If I could describe myself, Id say I am driven, a hard worker, independant, but also good at talking and working with people. Im smart, respectful and a fun person to be around. My favorite color is pink, and some of my hobbies include writing, playing xbox, traveling, trying new restaurants, coding, listening to music/podcasts, and more... </p>
        <h3>More info</h3>
